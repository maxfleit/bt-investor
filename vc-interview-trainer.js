let questions=[{question:"Why do you want a job in Venture Capital?",description:"This is one you can almost guarantee will be in any interview. The key here is to express what excites you about the VC industry. Is it getting to work with a variety of startups? Or help bring new companies into the world? Write down a few things alongside the skills you\u2019ve acquired thus far throughout your career and then explain why VC is the next logical step."},{question:"Which sector do you follow?",description:"Pick two or three sub-sectors and do in-depth research. You should be able to explain the trends in detail and know who the key players are. It is also helpful to give an outlook on how you think the market will develop in the coming years."},{question:"Which companies do you follow? Should we invest in them?",description:"Prepare a list of two to three interesting companies that you would look at as a VC. Make sure to include the sector and your reasoning."},{question:"Which of our investments do you like most and why?",description:"Read up on their portfolio companies and prepare to answer on two or three companies. You can also prepare special questions."},{question:"Which recent deal do you like most?",description:"Read up on two or three interesting deals that have happened in the industry and make sure you understand what has happened and know some details about the company itself."},{question:"How are the IPO markets at the moment?",description:"Talk about whether the IPO markets are doing well or not, whether you think there is a bubble, etc. The state of IPO markets is critical to venture capital firms because it's one of the most common way for them to realize their investments, so you need to be able to demonstrate whether the markets are doing well or not."},{question:"What are the top three VC firms in the industry? Who are our competitors?",description:"A simple question that you should be able to answer with some research."},{question:"Where do you see yourself in five years?",description:"This is quite an open question and there are no real answers - it's perfectly fine to mention that you may want to be an entrepreneur someday, or that you want to stay in venture capital and become a partner, or focus on a specific niche."},{question:"Why not become an entrepreneur?",description:"Because you prefer to look at a large diversity of companies, you want to focus on investment and strategy or you don't have a great idea yet. There are many ways to answer this question"},{question:"Why not go into private equity?",description:"Private equity and venture capital are two very different worlds. Good answers include: you prefer to invest in early-stage companies, you don't like the use of leverage by private equity, you feel that there is more potential in venture capital because of..., etc."},{question:"How many cans of Coca-Cola are drunken in London each day (or any other market sizing questions)?",description:"You may sometime come across brainteaser questions that test the way you think about problems. The way to answer them is to always break down the problem into various drivers. The interviewer wants to get to know your thinking process and not the perfect answer."},{question:"What makes you qualified for the role? What evidence can you provide to support that?",description:"When you are trying to sell yourself, you need to be very clear about why you are the best fit for the company, their mission, the job description, and expectations. First look at the qualifications the interviewer wants in a candidate from the job description. Think of some examples of how you embody these qualities."},{question:"Where have you succeeded and struggled? What did you learn from those experiences?",description:"An effective approach to the \u201Cfailure\u201D interview questions includes a story about the failure. While creating a few talking points is helpful, it can be even more helpful to use those points to create a narrative."},{question:"Why did you choose your past roles?",description:"Speak about the background and motivation for selecting your previous job."},{question:"How will you contribute to the firm?",description:" A question like this allows an interviewer to learn things like how you see yourself fitting into the company culture, your personal approach to working with others, the strength of your work ethic and how you can be an asset in the job."},{question:"Why VC as opposed to an operational role with a startup or launch your own company?",description:"You should be able to articulate why moving into the more general realm of VC makes sense (Opportunity to help more founders, build new skills, learn a new industry and from a different perspective etc.)."},{question:"What were you responsible for in your last job?",description:"There\u2019s no right or wrong approach to approach these sorts of questions. Concentrate on the most important points and be as specific as possible."},{question:"How do you expect your day in the role to be like?",description:"If you can, try and meet up with a past or present intern/analyst/associate from the firm for coffee. Read the firm\u2019s blog, check out people on the team on social media, subscribe to their newsletter, and look for clues. What processes do they talk about, what conferences do they go to, what have they been funding recently? Try and put together a picture of what that means in terms of how they spend their time."},{question:"What are some recent developments in the VC industry?",description:"Venture capital firms seek employees with proven expertise, often in a particular industry in which the firm focuses. You should not only showcase your knowledge of the overall developments and trends in the industry, but also elaborate on the specific influences in the market. Demonstrate knowledge that only an experienced industry insider would have. Discussing a particular company's product release or strategic decision would be a great method to do exactly that."},{question:"How do you assess an early-stage startup VS a later-stage startup?",description:"In a very generalized way, early-stage investors care more about evidence, while later-stage investors care more about proof."},{question:"How do you calculate the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?",description:"CAC is calculated by dividing the total cost of acquiring customers (cost of sales and marketing) over a given time period by the total number of customers acquired over that period of that time: CAC = (total cost of sales and marketing) / (# of customers acquired)"},{question:"What can you say about the ratio LTV/CAC?",description:"The LTV/CAC measures the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and the cost of acquiring that customer. This is a particularly crucial measure for subscription-based companies. Ideally, you want to recover the cost of acquiring a customer within the first 12 months or so. In other words, if the average customer brings you $1,500 over 50 months, you should be spending about $360 to acquire customers."},{question:"Can you tell me what Customer Lifetime Value is?",description:"Customer lifetime value helps you predict future revenue and measure long-term business success. CLTV tells you how much revenue your company can expect from a typical client over the course of the relationship. More to the point, CLTV helps you estimate how much you should invest in order to retain a customer."},{question:"What is the difference between pre-money and post-money?",description:"The difference between a pre-money valuation of a company and a post-money valuation of a company comes down to timing. A pre-money valuation of a company refers to the company's agreed-upon worth before it receives the next round of financing, while the post-money valuation of a company refers to its value immediately after receiving the capital."},{question:"What is the difference between Private Equity and VC?",description:"Private equity and venture capital buy different types of companies, invest different amounts of money, and claim different amounts of equity in the companies in which they invest. "},{question:"Choose one startup that you admire. Why?",description:"You can name any company you want, but make sure you have deeper knowledge about the company (culture, turnover, business model, etc.) so that you can explain why you have chosen exactly that company."},{question:"How would you value a company in general?",description:"There are several strategies to value a startup company (e.g. Scorecard Valuation Methodology, VC Valuation Method, Dave Berkus Valuation Method, ...). Make sure to inform yourself about different ones so that you can talk along."},{question:"Please walk me through the three financial statements!",description:"Focus on the major parts of the three financial statements.  A good answer will be at a high level and will provide commentary on the general purpose of each statement while still highlighting key aspects."},{question:"According to you, which startup is the most promising in our portfolio and why?",description:"This will require real research. You need to know their portfolio across the board and have compelling reasons behind your decisions. These could include factors like Business characteristics, company traction, alignment with firm strategy, or alignment with your personal thesis."},{question:"According to our investment thesis, do you have a startup in mind that we should look at? Why?",description:"This will require real research. You need to know their investment thesis and have compelling reasons behind your decision why a startup could be a potential fit."},{question:"Who are our VC's competitors?",description:"Do your research. You should know the competitors of the VC you are applying for and also be able to answer in which details they differ."},{question:"What is venture capital?",description:"VC firms raise capital from investors to create venture funds, which are used to buy equity in early- or late-stage companies, depending on the firm\u2019s specialization (although some VCs are stage-agnostic). These investments are locked in until a liquidity event, such as when the company is acquired or goes public, at which point VCs realize profits from their initial investment."},{question:"What are your career goals?",description:"Interviewers want to know whether you plan to stay at the company for a while, or if you're likely to leave at the first opportunity. Asking future-focused questions during interviews is very common. For employers, this tactic helps to reveal if you have any long-term visions or plans."},{question:"What are you really good at professionally?",description:"The main reason interviewers ask this question is to identify whether your strengths align with the needs of the company and the job's responsibilities. The company wants to learn whether you're a good fit for the role you're interviewing for. "},{question:"What are you not good at or not interested in?",description:"Your potential employer uses this seemingly innocent question to suss out your ability to perform your responsibilities. To determine which negative qualities or professional weaknesses you should say, research the position you want to get and determine which qualities would not have a significant impact."},{question:"Tell me about your most challenging professional experience.",description:"When employers ask you this interview question, they want to know what struggles you've faced in your previous jobs and how you overcame them. They also want to assess your problem-solving skills, which gives them an idea of how you'd face similar challenges in the role you're interviewing for."},{question:"What are your favorite VC news sites? ",description:"No matter if blog, newsletter or podcast. Be prepared for follow-up questions and explain why you find exactly these news sources exciting. Some prominent venture capitalists publish personal blogs or columns highlighting their perspectives on recent deals, upcoming IPOs, and general industry commentary. Staying in the loop with such conversations shows the interviewer that you are highly connected and have your finger on the industry pulse. "},{question:"Describe your current job responsibilities.",description:"The interviewer wants to understand if your skills and responsibilities align well with the work you should do at their company. You should explain your current job responsibilities and duties clearly and in detail to help them visualize the tasks you successfully complete."},{question:"What did you take into consideration when you chose this firm?",description:"The interviewer wants to learn about your career goals and how this position fits into your plan. Make sure that you are sincerely interested in the job and will be motivated to perform if hired. He also wants to find out what you know about the company, industry, position (and if you took the time to research)."},{question:"What differentiates a good VC from a great VC?",description:"This is more of a philosophical question. You could answer the performance of the fund, but the question is more about what the basis of the performance is. In our opinion, it is values like intellectual curiosity, dynamic thinking, network abilities, open-mindedness, and conviction. There are several articles on the web about it. Make sure to check them out."},{question:"Why VC right now? Do you think it's better to be a junior VC now and grow up in the industry or come back after having founded/scaled a company",description:"This can be a tricky one. You have to understand the path of the role you\u2019re interviewing for \u2013 some are strictly 2 \u2013 3 years and out of the firm, while others are hopeful you\u2019ll progress upward. More importantly, however, is to have a defensible rationale for why you\u2019d like to work as VC now."},{question:"What do you think of our investment in [portfolio company]?",description:"This will require real research. You need to know their portfolio across the board and have compelling reasons behind your decisions. These could include factors like Business characteristics, company traction, alignment with firm strategy, or alignment with your personal theses"},{question:"Who is the most interesting person you know and why?",description:"This open question is much more about getting to know you than it is about hearing your answer. Consider someone you know who you admire and believe is truly interesting. This question tests your interests, your character, and your network all at once."},{question:"Give me an example of 1-2 times in your life when you failed. What did you do about it?",description:"This is an opportunity to show your resiliency, adaptability, and persistence in the face of adversity"},{question:"What are you most proud of professionally?",description:"Your chosen accomplishment should tie to the potential responsibilities and interests already mentioned in the interview. You might focus on entrepreneurial endeavors, advisory you\u2019ve provided to startups, an internal project you led, or a side hustle "},{question:"What\u2019s something that we don\u2019t know about you from your resume?",description:"Let the interviewer get to know your personality. As VCs are often working in small teams, your sociability and ability to work together with the team is pretty important."},{question:"If a former boss said something about you, what would it be?",description:"Try to highlight the type of qualities your interviewer is looking for."},{question:"What have you learned from your internship in VC?",description:"Try to focus your answer around the similarities between what you did in the internship and the position you are applying for."},{question:"How would you find/source new startups?",description:"This is a pretty important question for most roles. An active deal flow is one of the most important tasks at a VC fund. You\u2019ll likely be expected to contribute meaningfully (or, in some cases, focus entirely) on sourcing. You can demonstrate this in a number of ways. Familiarity and experience with the different startup ecosystems (universities, accelerators, startup publications) are table stakes. A broad network that includes successful founders, other VCs, and investors is crucial. Highlight networks from your schools, previous roles (especially in successful tech firms), industry research you\u2019ve done, or otherwise, and then explain how you\u2019d effectively expand on your base."},{question:"What are the companies you're looking at right now? ",description:"Entering any interview, you should have a shortlist of companies that you think would be a good investment. Finding a few companies across each sector they cover is the minimum you should do. In the best case scenario, you\u2019ve developed a thesis for a sector (or multiple), where you\u2019ve deeply analyzed a vertical, sourced numerous startups, and potentially contacted the teams to assess"},{question:"What do you read?",description:"This is an opportunity to demonstrate your interest in venture capital, your expertise in a given area, and/or your personality. "},{question:"What has been the most interesting IPO or acquisition in [industry] in the past year?",description:"For an industry question, you should have answers for any industry of interest you\u2019ve highlighted. Beyond that, it would be good to have some knowledge of recent events in the sectors/geographies they cover and their specific portfolio companies."},{question:"What is a tech company in the public markets that are grossly undervalued/overvalued? Why?",description:"This question tests your thought process around how to value these companies and their potential for growth and profitability. The interviewer wants to see the passion for the space that\u2019s demonstrated through your understanding of the large incumbents or younger growing public companies. It\u2019s also yet another chance to prove your analytical capabilities and ability to hold a position thoughtfully and with conviction."},{question:"What is churn rate?",description:"The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Churn has important implications on the LTV of customers and, correspondingly, the amount that can be spent to acquire them."},{question:"What are the trade-offs of a fixed price equity financing vs. convertible or SAFE notes?",description:"Convertible notes and SAFE notes have risen in prominence due to the ease in closing early-stage rounds by deferring valuation debates until the company has matured. However, as a result, such notes make all parties\u2019 understandings of their own more confusing and can result in unplanned scenarios when traditional equity financing does occur. Traditional equity financing has the converse benefits and challenges: negotiating the price of the round requires all parties to agree at an early point, but benefit from greater clarity on valuation and ownership."},{question:"What is more important between growth and profitability?",description:"At the earliest stages, profitability is highly unlikely, so growth is often viewed most favorably. Over the longer horizon, growth is valuable in leading to eventual profitability and cash flows. The most successful startups will balance their growth goals against their long-term business plan. Touching on unit economics could also be helpful. Growth is only valuable so long as the LTV of acquired customers exceeds the upfront CAC. Alternatively, one needs to convincingly explain how an increased scale or some other shift will allow the business to become profitable."},{question:"Which one is generally the most relevant for a startup, EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue?",description:"Typically revenue, as many startups are not profitable and thus EV/EBITDA is nonsensical. Depending on the specific situation, one might also look at EV/Gross Profit or EV/User. At the earliest stages, none of these metrics may be useful, so analyzing qualitative factors will be important in valuing the business"},{question:"What are the different business models / monetization strategies of startups",description:"Know how different startups monetize and the relative advantages and disadvantages (e.G. Subscription Model, eCommerce, Ad-based). "},{question:"How is a venture capital firm\u2019s success measured? What KPIs are used? When is each most useful?",description:"The most important metrics for a VC's performance are TVPI (Total Value to Paid-in Capital Multiple), DPI (Distributions to Paid-in Capital), and IRR (Internal Rate of Return). Make sure you know what they mean and what they are good for."},{question:"What three terms other than valuation would you want to negotiate with a founder? These can be economic terms or control terms.",description:"Interviewers here are likely more interested in your understanding of different terms and supporting rationale for your decision than three specific terms. Some key terms include Liquidation Preference, Dividends, Pro-Rata Rights, Option Pools, Board of Directors, Drag-Along Rights, Information Rights..."},{question:"What is a private tech company that is mismanaged/managed correctly and why?",description:"This question tests your knowledge and passion for the space, while also exploring your ability to build and hold an opinion. This also digs into your knowledge of the tech landscape by limiting to private tech companies only."}];$(".vc-question-button").on("click",function(){var a=questions[Math.floor(Math.random()*questions.length)];$(".vc-question-trainer > h2").html(a.question),$(".vc-question-trainer > .vc-question-p").html(a.description)})
